turnkey-lamp-17.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Updated all relevant Debian packages to Bullseye/11 versions; including
    PHP 7.4.

  * Provide predefined dh_params (via 'turnkey-make-ssl-cert' where relevant)
    as per RFC7919 - part of #1653.

  * Updated version of mysqltuner script.

  * Enable HTTP/2 by default (where possible). Note: will not actually work
    until a CA signed cert is generated or installed.

  * Configure OCSP stapling (will only work once a valid cert is configured).

  * Enable HSTS by default (only effects HTTPS traffic - full implementation
    also requires HTTP redirect to HTTPS and valid cert).

  * Enable Apache mod-headers by default (required for HSTS).

  * Disable cipher order in default ssl.conf (no longer required with the
    secure cipher suites we use; mild improvement in cpu resources).

  * Update Apache's mod-python to use python3. Also update included python
    mysql module to use python3 variant (python3-mysqldb).

  * Retab default site file (000-default.conf) to make the indentation
    consistent (cosmetic change only).

  * Reorgnaise/refactor build code so there is now a dedicated apache.mk
    file. (Development - should have no end user impact).

    all appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
